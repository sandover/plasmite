A single `Mutex\u003cHashMap\u003cString, SeqOffsetCache\u003e\u003e` would serialize ALL get requests across ALL pools for the duration of that scan. This is wrong.\n\nUse a two-level locking pattern instead:\n- Outer: `Mutex\u003cHashMap\u003cString, Arc\u003cMutex\u003cSeqOffsetCache\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e` â held briefly to look up or insert the per-pool Arc.\n- Inner: per-pool `Mutex\u003cSeqOffsetCache\u003e` â held for the duration of `get_with_cache`, only serializes gets within the same pool.\n\nThe pattern in each handler:\n```rust\nlet cache_arc = {\n    let mut map = state.seq_caches.lock().unwrap();\n    map.entry(pool_name.to_string())\n        .or_insert_with(|| Arc::new(Mutex::new(SeqOffsetCache::new(256))))\n        .clone()\n};\nlet mut cache = cache_arc.lock().unwrap();\npool.get_with_cache(seq, \u0026mut cache)?;\n```\n\nThe outer lock is held for only the HashMap lookup (nanoseconds). The inner lock serializes gets per-pool, which is acceptable â concurrent gets on the same pool are rare, and the mmap read is fast on cache hit.\n\nDefault cache capacity: 256 entries per pool.

Resolve the pool name from the request.\n2. Get the per-pool `Arc\u003cMutex\u003cSeqOffsetCache\u003e\u003e` from `state.seq_caches` (brief outer lock).\n3. Lock the per-pool cache.\n4.

You must call `pool.get_with_cache()` directly and do the message construction yourself.

There's ~4KB of reserved space (bytes 88-4095) to use.\n\n### Ring offset change\n`ring_offset` is currently always 4096 (HEADER_SIZE). It must now be `HEADER_SIZE + (index_capacity * 16)`. Update `PoolHeader::new()` to accept index_capacity, compute ring_offset accordingly, and validate.\n\n### Pool creation\n`Pool::create()` and `PoolOptions` must accept an optional index_capacity. Default: `min(pool_size / 256, 65536)` (proportional to pool size, capped). The user-requested pool size is the total file size â the index region comes out of that budget.\n\n### Format version bump\nBump POOL_FORMAT_VERSION. Old code opening new pools will get a version error (acceptable â zero users on old format).\n\n### Validation updates\n- `PoolHeader::validate()`: ring_offset must equal HEADER_SIZE + (index_capacity * 16).\n- index_capacity * 16 must fit between HEADER_SIZE and ring_offset.\n- ring_size must still be \u003e 0 after the index region is allocated.\n\n### Zero-initialization\nOn create, the index region is zeroed. A slot with seq=0 is treated as empty (seq 0 is never assigned â seqs start at 1).\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- Pool files created with the new format have the correct layout: header | index | ring.\n- `ring_offset` varies based on index_capacity.\n- Existing pool tests that create pools continue to work (they'll get default index_capacity).\n- New pools can be opened and read with the updated decode.\n- Format version rejects old pools (or old code rejects new pools).\n\n## Automated validation gates\n- `cargo test` passes (all existing tests adapted to new format).\n- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean.\n- A pool created with `PoolOptions::new(1048576)` has index_capacity \u003e 0 and ring_offset \u003e 4096.\n\n## Testing ideas\n- Create pool, verify header fields: index_offset, index_capacity, ring_offset.\n- Create pool with explicit index_capacity=0, verify ring_offset == 4096 (degenerate case, scan-only).\n- Create pool with tiny size, verify index doesn't eat all the ring space.\n- Round-trip: create, close, reopen, verify all header fields survive.\n","created_at":"2026-02-06T20:48:38.330486Z"}}

Correct.\n- If crash after step 5, before step 6: index points to valid committed frame, but header hasn't advanced. Reader won't request this seq yet. Correct on next append (header catches up).\n\n### Index slot write\nByte offset in the mmap: `index_offset + (seq % index_capacity) * 16`.\nWrite: 8 bytes LE seq, then 8 bytes LE ring-relative offset.\n\n### Flush durability\nWhen durability=Flush, add a flush_mmap_range call for the index slot (16 bytes at the computed offset). This goes between the frame flush and the header flush, matching the write ordering.\n\n### index_capacity = 0\nIf the pool was created with index_capacity=0, skip the index write entirely. This is the degenerate/fallback mode.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- After append, the index slot at `seq % capacity` contains the correct (seq, offset) pair.\n- Append performance regression is minimal (one 16-byte aligned write per append).\n- Flush mode flushes the index slot.\n- index_capacity=0 pools still work (no index write).\n\n## Automated validation gates\n- `cargo test` passes.\n- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean.\n- Existing append benchmarks don't regress more than ~5%.\n\n## Testing ideas\n- Append 10 messages, read index slots directly from mmap, verify (seq, offset) pairs.\n- Append enough to cause ring wrap + drop-oldest, verify index slots update correctly for new seqs.\n- Append with durability=Flush, verify no crash (flush range covers index).\n- Append with index_capacity=0, verify no out-of-bounds write.\n","created_at":"2026-02-06T20:48:59.762998Z"}}

There's ~4KB of reserved space (bytes 88-4095) to use.\n\n### Ring offset change\n`ring_offset` is currently always 4096 (HEADER_SIZE). It must now be `HEADER_SIZE + (index_capacity * 16)`. Update `PoolHeader::new()` to accept index_capacity, compute ring_offset accordingly, and validate.\n\n### Pool creation\n`Pool::create()` and `PoolOptions` must accept an optional index_capacity. Default: auto-sized. The user-requested pool size is the total file size â the index region comes out of that budget (same as the header does today).\n\n**Auto-sizing formula (important â must not break on small pools):**\n```\nlet candidate = min(pool_size / 256, 65536);\nlet index_bytes = candidate * 16;\nlet ring_remaining = pool_size.saturating_sub(HEADER_SIZE + index_bytes);\nif ring_remaining \u003c MIN_RING_SIZE {\n    // reduce capacity until ring_remaining \u003e= MIN_RING_SIZE, or set to 0\n}\n```\nMIN_RING_SIZE should be at least one maximum-sized frame (or a reasonable floor like 1024 bytes). This prevents the index from consuming all usable space on small pools (e.g. `--size 4200` would produce a negative ring without this guard).\n\n**PoolOptions API:** Add a builder method: `PoolOptions::new(file_size).with_index_capacity(1024)`. When unset, auto-size. When set to 0, no index.\n\n### Format version bump\nBump POOL_FORMAT_VERSION (currently 2 â 3). Old code opening new pools will get a version error (acceptable â zero users on old format).\n\n### Validation updates\n- `PoolHeader::validate()`: ring_offset must equal HEADER_SIZE + (index_capacity * 16).\n- index_capacity * 16 must fit between HEADER_SIZE and ring_offset.\n- ring_size must still be \u003e MIN_RING_SIZE after the index region is allocated.\n\n### Zero-initialization\nOn create, the index region is zeroed. A slot with seq=0 is treated as empty (seq 0 is never assigned â seqs start at 1).\n\n### Doctor\n`plasmite doctor` currently validates the ring. With the new layout, doctor must:\n- Recognize the index region (use ring_offset from header, not assume 4096).\n- Optionally spot-check a few index slots: if entry.seq != 0, verify the frame at entry.offset has a matching seq. Report stale/invalid entries as warnings (not corruption â staleness is expected).\n\n### Conformance suite\nThe C ABI's `plsm_pool_create` will now produce pools with different ring_offset. Run the conformance suite (Go, Python, Node runners) as a validation gate to confirm all bindings still work.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- Pool files created with the new format have the correct layout: header | index | ring.\n- `ring_offset` varies based on index_capacity.\n- Small pools (e.g. 8KB) get a reduced or zero index_capacity automatically â never a negative ring.\n- Existing pool tests that create pools continue to work (they'll get default index_capacity).\n- New pools can be opened and read with the updated decode.\n- Format version rejects old pools (or old code rejects new pools).\n- `plasmite doctor` works on new-format pools without false corruption reports.\n- Conformance suite passes.\n\n## Automated validation gates\n- `cargo test` passes (all existing tests adapted to new format).\n- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean.\n- Conformance suite passes (Go, Python, Node runners).\n- A pool created with `PoolOptions::new(1048576)` has index_capacity \u003e 0 and ring_offset \u003e 4096.\n- A pool created with `PoolOptions::new(4200)` has a valid ring_size \u003e 0 (auto-sizing reduced the index).\n\n## Testing ideas\n- Create pool, verify header fields: index_offset, index_capacity, ring_offset.\n- Create pool with explicit index_capacity=0, verify ring_offset == 4096 (degenerate case, scan-only).\n- Create pool with tiny size (e.g. 4200, 5000, 8192), verify auto-sizing doesn't break â ring_size \u003e 0 in all cases.\n- Create pool with minimum valid size, verify index_capacity is 0 or very small.\n- Round-trip: create, close, reopen, verify all header fields survive.\n- Run `plasmite doctor` on new-format pool, verify no false corruption.\n","ts":"2026-02-06T20:54:38.874713Z"}}

The remote client (pure JS, zero native deps) is unreachable because the import fails before it. Node is the only binding without multi-platform CI builds.\n\nThe established pattern for native npm packages (esbuild, turbo, swc, oxc) uses platform-specific optional packages (`@plasmite/linux-x64`, `@plasmite/darwin-arm64`, etc.) with a main package that gracefully degrades when native deps are unavailable.\n\n## Scope\n- Fix `index.js` so the remote client is always importable (no native crash)\n- Build the N-API addon on all three platforms in CI\n- Split into platform-specific packages following the esbuild pattern\n- Wire platform packages into the release build and publish workflows\n- Update the npm README and package.json metadata\n\n## Impact on release system\nThis adds npm platform packages to the publish matrix. The release simplification proposal (docs/planning/release-process-simplification-proposal.md) should be adopted first or concurrently to avoid compounding complexity onto the existing fragile release infrastructure. Specifically: the partial-release controls being removed in that proposal would conflict with adding more npm packages to publish.\n\n## Success criteria\n- `npm install plasmite` works on Linux x86_64, macOS x86_64, and macOS arm64\n- `require(\"plasmite\").RemoteClient` works on all platforms without native deps\n- `require(\"plasmite\").Client` works on platforms with the native package installed\n- `require(\"plasmite\").Client` throws a clear error message on unsupported platforms\n- `npx plasmite --version` works on all supported platforms\n- Platform packages are published atomically with the main package during releases\n","created_at":"2026-02-10T23:16:01.560117Z"}}

The remote client (pure JS, zero native deps) is unreachable because the import fails before it. Node is the only binding without multi-platform CI builds.\n\n## Approach\nBundle all three platforms native binaries in one npm package. The package stays `plasmite` on npm — no new packages, no scope, no org, no publish ordering. `index.js` resolves the right native addon for the current platform at runtime.\n\nDirectory layout inside the published tarball:\n```\nnative/\n  linux-x64/     index.node, libplasmite.so, plasmite\n  darwin-x64/    index.node, libplasmite.dylib, plasmite\n  darwin-arm64/  index.node, libplasmite.dylib, plasmite\n```\n\nDownload size increases (~30-50 MB total) but the package stays simple: one publish, one page, same release flow.\n\n## Success criteria\n- `npm install plasmite` works on Linux x86_64, macOS x86_64, and macOS arm64\n- `require(\"plasmite\").RemoteClient` works on all platforms without native deps\n- `require(\"plasmite\").Client` works on all three supported platforms\n- `require(\"plasmite\").Client` throws a clear error on unsupported platforms\n- `npx plasmite --version` works on all supported platforms\n- One npm package published per release (same as today)\n","ts":"2026-02-10T23:53:21.460314Z"}}

This epic must not repeat that pattern.\n\n## Principles (lessons from the release trail of tears)\n1. **Gate on runner access first.** Don't write matrix entries for a runner that might not be available.\n2. **Match existing platform patterns exactly.** Linux x86 doesn't upload a Python wheel (no manylinux). Linux ARM64 must do the same — don't ship broken artifacts.\n3. **ARM failures must not block other platforms.** The Node dist assembly job downloads artifacts by exact name. A missing ARM artifact must not block x86/macOS tarballs.\n4. **Respect the actual CI matrix shape.** The `full` job uses `os:` not `target:`. Tasks must describe changes that match the real YAML, not an imagined structure.\n5. **Structural validation where functional validation is impossible.** ARM addons can't be loaded on x86 runners. Verify file existence and paths, not runtime behavior.\n\n## Scope\n- Extend existing matrices and packaging paths for Linux ARM64.\n- Update Homebrew formula/scripts to accept Linux ARM64 artifacts.\n- Validate via existing workflows and smoke tests.\n\n## Non-Goals\n- No new build systems, wrappers, or orchestration layers.\n- No changes to release policy or partial-release behavior.\n- No manylinux container builds (out of scope; Linux wheels remain sdist-only for now).\n- No speculative support for additional architectures.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All child tasks are done.\n- Existing CI/release workflows include Linux ARM64 where required.\n- ARM build failures do not block cross-platform artifact assembly.\n- Validation shows Linux ARM64 artifacts are built, packaged, and consumable.\n\n## Consult Me\n- If `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner is unavailable or cost-prohibitive, pause and ask before introducing cross-compilation or emulation.\n- If Node dist assembly can't be made resilient to missing ARM artifacts without significant refactoring, pause and ask.\n","ts":"2026-02-11T18:36:50.768212Z"}}

It downloads platform artifacts by exact name, restores execute bits, and runs a smoke test. It was the primary source of the v0.1.3–v0.1.13 release fix spiral. Changes here must be minimal and defensive.\n\n## Changes\n\n### Add ARM artifact download (after line ~252)\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4\n  with:\n    name: node-native-linux-arm64\n    path: bindings/node/native/linux-arm64\n  continue-on-error: true\n```\n\n`continue-on-error: true` ensures that if the ARM build fails or the artifact is missing, the dist assembly still succeeds for x86/macOS platforms. This is the key difference from the original plan — ARM must not block cross-platform distribution.\n\n### Structural validation (after the \"Restore native CLI execute bits\" step)\nAdd a step that checks which platform directories were downloaded:\n```yaml\n- name: Report assembled platforms\n  run: |\n    echo \"Assembled platforms:\"\n    ls -la bindings/node/native/\n    for dir in bindings/node/native/*/; do\n      echo \"  $(basename \"$dir\"): $(ls \"$dir\" | wc -l) files\"\n    done\n```\n\n### Do NOT change the smoke test\nThe smoke test runs on x86 and can only load x86 addons.

This requires short, incremental CI loops and strong stage gates.\n\n## Scope (Phase 1: preview-first)\n- Add a minimal Windows build path that produces usable prebuilt artifacts (no local compile required for end users).\n- Start with a dedicated Windows preview workflow and fast CI smoke checks.\n- Keep existing release-publish workflow behavior unchanged in Phase 1.\n- Document clear support boundaries (preview/best-effort) and expected user path (remote-first or native preview binary).\n\n## Non-Goals (Phase 1)\n- Do not claim full Windows parity across all channels (PyPI/npm/Homebrew) in one step.\n- Do not refactor core release orchestration or add broad new automation layers.\n- Do not add platform-specific complexity outside build/packaging boundaries unless required for compilation/runtime correctness.\n- Do not include `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` in Phase 1; ARM64 Windows scope is deferred to graduation planning.\n\n## Risk Controls\n- Isolate Windows rollout in dedicated jobs/workflows first; avoid modifying `release-publish.yml` until Windows artifacts are proven stable.\n- Require each stage to pass before expanding scope (probe infra -\u003e strategy validation -\u003e implementation -\u003e smoke -\u003e preview distribution -\u003e docs).\n- Prefer reversible changes and explicit compatibility shims over invasive rewrites.\n\n## Decisions / Open Questions / Assumptions\n- Decision needed: default Windows C compiler strategy (`cl.exe` + compatibility shim vs `clang-cl`).\n- Decision needed: artifact channel for Phase 1 (manual preview workflow vs inclusion in official release assets).\n- Assumption: initial user value is prebuilt CLI/SDK availability; Python/Node Windows packaging can be staged after base artifact stability.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- A Win11 user can download a prebuilt artifact and run `plasmite --version` without compiling.\n- CI provides a reliable Windows smoke signal on pull requests touching build/packaging paths.\n- Existing macOS/Linux release/publish flows remain green and unchanged in behavior.\n","ts":"2026-02-13T19:19:32.4497Z"}}

This requires short, incremental CI loops and strong stage gates.\n\n## Scope (Phase 1: preview-first)\n- Add a minimal Windows build path that produces usable prebuilt artifacts (no local compile required for end users).\n- Start with a dedicated Windows preview workflow and fast CI smoke checks.\n- Keep existing release-publish workflow behavior unchanged in Phase 1.\n- Document clear support boundaries (preview/best-effort) and expected user path (remote-first or native preview binary).\n\n## Non-Goals (Phase 1)\n- Do not claim full Windows parity across all channels (PyPI/npm/Homebrew) in one step.\n- Do not refactor core release orchestration or add broad new automation layers.\n- Do not add platform-specific complexity outside build/packaging boundaries unless required for compilation/runtime correctness.\n- Do not include `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` in Phase 1; ARM64 Windows scope is deferred to graduation planning.\n\n## Risk Controls\n- Isolate Windows rollout in dedicated jobs/workflows first; avoid modifying `release-publish.yml` until Windows artifacts are proven stable.\n- Require each stage to pass before expanding scope (probe infra -\u003e strategy validation -\u003e implementation -\u003e smoke -\u003e preview distribution -\u003e docs).\n- Prefer reversible changes and explicit compatibility shims over invasive rewrites.\n\n## Decisions / Open Questions / Assumptions\n- Decision resolved (2026-02-13): default Windows C compiler strategy is `clang-cl` (evidence captured in `6QBXG4`, successful probe run `22001090359`).\n- Open question: artifact channel for Phase 1 (manual preview workflow artifacts only vs inclusion in official release assets).\n- Assumption: initial user value is prebuilt CLI/SDK availability; Python/Node Windows packaging can be staged after base artifact stability.\n\n## Execution Plan (Current Order)\n1. `CLZIPU` — implement Windows Lite3 build compatibility and validate compile behavior.\n2. `GGETR4` — define preview rollback policy for the Windows CI gate.\n3. `VHY2OH` — add fast `windows-latest` smoke gate aligned to rollback policy.\n4. `BOW56E` — add isolated Windows preview artifact workflow.\n5. `GWDIVC` — publish Windows preview install/support policy docs.\n6. `AY7WK2` — spike Windows Python/Node packaging scope after preview docs are in place.\n7. `6ZEGZW` — define graduation gates for moving beyond preview.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- A Win11 user can download a prebuilt artifact and run `plasmite --version` without compiling.\n- CI provides a reliable Windows smoke signal on pull requests touching build/packaging paths.\n- Existing macOS/Linux release/publish flows remain green and unchanged in behavior.\n","ts":"2026-02-13T20:22:45.532394Z"}}

Move the logic into `Pool.prototype.replay` and have the module function call it.\n- Tag filtering is client-side (parse each message, check `meta.tags` contains all required tags) — same approach as Python/Go.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- `for await (const msg of pool.tail({ tags: [\"x\"], timeoutMs: 100, maxMessages: 5 }))` works.\n- `for await (const msg of pool.replay({ speed: 2.0 }))` works.\n- Module-level `replay(pool, opts)` still works unchanged.\n- Tail respects `sinceSeq`, `maxMessages`, `timeoutMs`, and `tags` options.\n- Early `break` from the generator properly closes the underlying stream.\n- Methods declared in `types.d.ts`.\n- Tests cover: tail with tag filter, tail timeout with no messages, replay as method.\n\n## Validation Gates\n- `cd bindings/node \u0026\u0026 node --test test/*.test.js`\n- `cd bindings/node \u0026\u0026 npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`\n","created_at":"2026-02-18T01:12:03.890172Z"}}

The local Message must be compatible without breaking\n  existing remote consumers. Spike must resolve this.\n- **Go interface change** — changing `Append`/`Get` return types from `[]byte` to `*Message`\n  is a breaking change to the `api.Pool` interface.
