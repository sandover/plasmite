# Planning

`docs/planning/` is the only planning namespace.

Use it only for active, in-flight planning artifacts.
Stale plans, spikes, and superseded drafts should be deleted.

## Active planning docs

- Roadmap: `docs/planning/roadmap.md`

Promotion workflow:

1. Draft/update in `docs/planning/`.
2. Review and accept.
3. Promote accepted content to `docs/record/` (or `docs/decisions/` for ADRs).
