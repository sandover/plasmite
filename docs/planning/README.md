# Planning Docs

This namespace contains in-flight planning documents: proposals, audits, and policies
that are still subject to change.

When a plan becomes accepted “current truth,” promote it into `docs/record/` (docs of
record) and/or capture the decision in `docs/decisions/` (Architecture Decision
Records).

## Start here

- Roadmap: `docs/planning/roadmap.md`

## Current planning docs

- Windows support plan (build strategy, graduation gates, bindings scope): `docs/planning/windows.md`
