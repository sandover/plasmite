# Docs of Record

Place stable, canonical documentation here:

- operator/developer references
- usage guides and quickstarts
- maintenance and release procedures
- architecture/reference docs intended as current truth

Do not place proposals, exploratory design drafts, or roadmap notes here.
Those belong in `docs/planning/` until promoted.
