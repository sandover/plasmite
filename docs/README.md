# Docs

Plasmite documentation is intentionally split into:

- `docs/record/`: canonical docs of record

- `docs/decisions/`: ADRs (also docs of record)

## Start here

- Docs of record: `docs/record/README.md`
- Planning: `docs/planning/README.md`
- Decisions (ADRs): `docs/decisions/README.md`

## Normative specs

- v0 CLI + message contract: `spec/v0/SPEC.md`
- v0 public API contract: `spec/api/v0/SPEC.md`
- v0 remote protocol: `spec/remote/v0/SPEC.md`

## Keystone docs of record

- Vision: `docs/record/vision.md`
- Architecture: `docs/record/architecture.md`

## Reference docs of record
